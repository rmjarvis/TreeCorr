See the listing below for the complete list of new features and changes.
`Relevant PRs and Issues,
<https://github.com/rmjarvis/TreeCorr/issues?q=milestone%3A%22Version+4.3%22+is%3Aclosed>`_
whose issue numbers are listed below for the relevant items.

Starting with this version, TreeCorr no longer supports Python 2.7.
We currently support python versions 3.6, 3.7, 3,8, 3.9, 3.10.


API Changes
-----------

- Many function parameters are now keyword-only.  The old syntax allowing these parameters
  to be positional still works, but is deprecated. (#129)


Performance improvements
------------------------

- Added ability to compute patch-based covariance matrices using MPI. (#138, #139)


New features
------------

- Added ability to write out the full set of pair-wise results in the write commands, and to
  read them back in.  This allows correlation objects to still be able to correctly calculate
  the various patch-based covariance matrix estimates after round-tripping through a file.
  To use this feature, use ``corr.write(..., write_patch_results=True)``.
  (#141)
- Allow None as a configuration parameter to be equivalent to not specifying a parameter.
  E.g. ``bin_size=0.1, min_sep=1., max_sep=100., nbins=None`` is allowed now. (#142)

Bug fixes
---------

- Fixed a bug where correlation objects using bin_type=TwoD could not be correctly read back
  in after being written to a file. (#141)
