Three-point Correlation Functions
=================================

There are currently 3 differenct classes for calculating the different possible three-point
correlation functions:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    nnn
    ggg
    kkk
    kkg
    kgg

Each of the above classes is a sub-class of the base class Corr3, so they have a number of
features in common about how they are constructed.  The common features are documented here.

.. autoclass:: treecorr.Corr3
    :members:
