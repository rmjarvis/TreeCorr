// This is the only thing about Metric that we need in python.

// We use a code for the metric to use:
// Euclidean is Euclidean in (x,y) or (x,y,z)
// Perp uses the perpendicular component of the separation as the distance
// Lens uses the perpendicular component at the lens (the first catalog) distance
// Arc uses the great circle distance between two points on the sphere

// This is the C++ way to do it.
//enum Metric { Euclidean=1, Perp=2, Lens=3, Arc=4 };

// But this is how we need to do it in C.
typedef enum { Euclidean=1, Rperp=2, Lens=3, Arc=4, OldRperp=5 } Metric;
