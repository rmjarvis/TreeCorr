# The file with the data to be correlated:
# (available from https://github.com/rmjarvis/TreeCorr/wiki/Aardvark.fit)
file_name: data/Aardvark.fit

# What are the names of the columns for ra, dec and what kind of values do they have:
ra_col: RA          # The column name for RA values in the input file
dec_col: DEC        # The column name for Dec values in the input file
ra_units: degrees   # The units of the RA values
dec_units: degrees  # The units of the Dec values

# What are the names of the columns for the lensing observables to be correlated
g1_col: GAMMA1      # The column name of the g1 component of shear
g2_col: GAMMA2      # The column name of the g2 component of shear
k_col: KAPPA        # The column name of kappa
                    # Note: k_col can be used for any scalar field, not just lensing kappa.

# Define the binning.  Binning in TreeCorr uses bins that are equally spaced in log(r).
# (i.e. Natural log, not log10.)  There are four parameters of which you may specify any 3.
min_sep: 1          # The minimum separation that you want included.
max_sep: 400        # The maximum separation that you want included.
nbins: 100          # The number of bins
#bin_size: 0.06     # The width of the bins in log(r).  In this case automatically calculated
                    # to be bin_size = log(max_sep/min_sep) / nbins ~= 0.06
sep_units: arcmin   # The units of min_sep, max_sep

# The name of the output file:
# Here, because this field is called gg_file_name, it implies that a GG (i.e. shear-shear)
# correlation should be performed and written out to this file.
gg_file_name: output/Aardvark.out

# Set the level of verbosity that you want.
# 0 prints nothing unless there is an error.
# 1 is the default, which prints warnings and a few progress lines.
# 2 and 3 print more information about what is happening at each stage.
verbose: 2
