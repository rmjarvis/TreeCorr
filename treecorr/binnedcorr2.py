    """This class stores the results of a 2-point correlation calculation, along with some
    ancillary data.

    This is a base class that is not intended to be constructed directly.  But it has a few
    helper functions that derived classes can use to help perform their calculations.  See
    the derived classes for more details:

    - `GGCorrelation` handles shear-shear correlation functions
    - `NNCorrelation` handles count-count correlation functions
    - `KKCorrelation` handles kappa-kappa correlation functions
    - `NGCorrelation` handles count-shear correlation functions
    - `NKCorrelation` handles count-kappa correlation functions
    - `KGCorrelation` handles kappa-shear correlation functions

    .. note::

        When we refer to kappa in the correlation functions, that is because TreeCorr was
        originally designed for weak lensing applications.  But in fact any scalar quantity
        may be used here.  CMB temperature fluctuations for example.

    The constructor for all derived classes take a config dict as the first argument,
    since this is often how we keep track of parameters, but if you don't want to
    use one or if you want to change some parameters from what are in a config dict,
    then you can use normal kwargs, which take precedence over anything in the config dict.

    There are a number of possible definitions for the distance between two points, which
    are appropriate for different use cases.  These are specified by the ``metric`` parameter.
    The possible options are:

        - 'Euclidean' = straight line Euclidean distance between two points.
        - 'FisherRperp' = the perpendicular component of the distance, following the
          definitions in Fisher et al, 1994 (MNRAS, 267, 927).
        - 'OldRperp' = the perpendicular component of the distance using the definition
          of Rperp from TreeCorr v3.x.
        - 'Rperp' = an alias for FisherRperp.  You can change it to be an alias for
          OldRperp if you want by setting ``treecorr.Rperp_alias = 'OldRperp'`` before
          using it.
        - 'Rlens' = the distance from the first object (taken to be a lens) to the line
          connecting Earth and the second object (taken to be a lensed source).
        - 'Arc' = the true great circle distance for spherical coordinates.
        - 'Periodic' = Like Euclidean, but with periodic boundaries.

    See `Metrics` for more information about these various metric options.

    There are also a few different possibile binning prescriptions to define the range of
    distances, which should be placed into each bin.

        - 'Log' - logarithmic binning in the distance.  The bin steps will be uniform in
          log(r) from log(min_sep) .. log(max_sep).
        - 'Linear' - linear binning in the distance.  The bin steps will be uniform in r
          from min_sep .. max_sep.
        - 'TwoD' = 2-dimensional binning from x = (-max_sep .. max_sep) and
          y = (-max_sep .. max_sep).  The bin steps will be uniform in both x and y.
          (i.e. linear in x,y)

    See `Binning` for more information about the different binning options.

    Parameters:
        config (dict):      A configuration dict that can be used to pass in the below kwargs if
                            desired.  This dict is allowed to have addition entries in addition
                            to those listed below, which are ignored here. (default: None)
        logger:             If desired, a logger object for logging. (default: None, in which case
                            one will be built according to the config dict's verbose level.)

    Keyword Arguments:

        nbins (int):        How many bins to use. (Exactly three of nbins, bin_size, min_sep,
                            max_sep are required. If nbins is not given, it will be calculated from
                            the values of the other three, rounding up to the next highest integer.
                            In this case, bin_size will be readjusted to account for this rounding
                            up.)
        bin_size (float):   The width of the bins in log(separation). (Exactly three of nbins,
                            bin_size, min_sep, max_sep are required.  If bin_size is not given, it
                            will be calculated from the values of the other three.)
        min_sep (float):    The minimum separation in units of sep_units, if relevant. (Exactly
                            three of nbins, bin_size, min_sep, max_sep are required.  If min_sep is
                            not given, it will be calculated from the values of the other three.)
        max_sep (float):    The maximum separation in units of sep_units, if relevant. (Exactly
                            three of nbins, bin_size, min_sep, max_sep are required.  If max_sep is
                            not given, it will be calculated from the values of the other three.

        sep_units (str):    The units to use for the separation values, given as a string.  This
                            includes both min_sep and max_sep above, as well as the units of the
                            output distance values.  Valid options are arcsec, arcmin, degrees,
                            hours, radians.  (default: radians if angular units make sense, but for
                            3-d or flat 2-d positions, the default will just match the units of
                            x,y[,z] coordinates)
        bin_slop (float):   How much slop to allow in the placement of pairs in the bins.
                            If bin_slop = 1, then the bin into which a particular pair is placed
                            may be incorrect by at most 1.0 bin widths.  (default: None, which
                            means to use a bin_slop that gives a maximum error of 10% on any bin,
                            which has been found to yield good results for most application.
        brute (bool):       Whether to use the "brute force" algorithm.  (default: False) Options
                            are:

                             - False (the default): Stop at non-leaf cells whenever the error in
                               the separation is compatible with the given bin_slop.
                             - True: Go to the leaves for both catalogs.
                             - 1: Always go to the leaves for cat1, but stop at non-leaf cells of
                               cat2 when the error is compatible with the given bin_slop.
                             - 2: Always go to the leaves for cat2, but stop at non-leaf cells of
                               cat1 when the error is compatible with the given bin_slop.

                            to use:

                             - 0 means no logging output
                             - 1 means to output warnings only (default)
                             - 2 means to output various progress information
                             - 3 means to output extensive debugging information

        output_dots (bool): Whether to output progress dots during the calcualtion of the
                            correlation function. (default: False unless verbose is given and >= 2,

        split_method (str): How to split the cells in the tree when building the tree structure.

        This function will calculate an estimate of the covariance matrix according to the
        given method.

        Options for ``method`` include:

            - 'shot' = The variance based on "shot noise" only.  This includes the Poisson
              counts of points for N statistics, shape noise for G statistics, and the observed
              scatter in the values for K statistics.  In this case, the returned covariance
              matrix will be diagonal, since there is no way to estimate the off-diagonal terms.
            - 'jackknife' = A jackknife estimate of the covariance matrix based on the scatter
              in the measurement when excluding one patch at a time.
            - 'sample' = An estimate based on the sample covariance of a set of samples,
              taken as the patches of the input catalog.
            - 'bootstrap' = A bootstrap covariance estimate. It selects patches at random with
              replacement and then generates the statistic using all the auto-correlations at
              their selected repetition plus all the cross terms that aren't actually auto terms.
            - 'marked_bootstrap' = An estimate based on a marked-point bootstrap resampling of the
              patches.  Similar to bootstrap, but only samples the patches of the first catalog and
              uses all patches from the second catalog that correspond to each patch selection of
              the first catalog.  cf. https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ApJ...681..726L/

        Both 'bootstrap' and 'marked_bootstrap' use the num_bootstrap parameter, which can be set on
        construction.

        .. note::

            For most classes, there is only a single statistic, so this calculates a covariance
            matrix for that vector.  `GGCorrelation` has two: ``xip`` and ``xim``, so in this
            case the full data vector is ``xip`` followed by ``xim``, and this calculates the
            covariance matrix for that full vector including both statistics.  The helper
            function `getStat` returns the relevant statistic in all cases.

        In all cases, the relevant processing needs to already have been completed and finalized.
        And for all methods other than 'shot', the processing should have involved an appropriate
        number of patches -- preferably more patches than the length of the vector for your
        statistic, although this is not checked.

        The default data vector to use for the covariance matrix is given by the method
        `getStat`.  As noted above, this is usually just self.xi.  However, there is an option
        to compute the covariance of some other function of the correlation object by providing
        an arbitrary function, ``func``, which should act on the current correlation object
        and return the data vector of interest.

        For instance, for an `NGCorrelation`, you might want to compute the covariance of the
        imaginary part, ``ng.xi_im``, rather than the real part.  In this case you could use

            >>> func = lambda ng: ng.xi_im

        The return value from this func should be a single numpy array. (This is not directly
        checked, but you'll probably get some kind of exception if it doesn't behave as expected.)

        .. note::

            The optional ``func`` parameter is not valid in conjunction with ``method='shot'``.
            It only works for the methods that are based on patch combinations.

        Parameters:
            method (str):       Which method to use to estimate the covariance matrix.
            func (function):    A unary function that acts on the current correlation object and
                                returns the desired data vector. [default: None, which is
                                equivalent to ``lambda corr: corr.getStat()``.

        have actual separations slightly outside of the specified range.  If you want a selection

        tree that TreeCorr used to place the pairs into the given bin.  Therefore, if these cells
        were not leaf cells, then they will not typically be equal to the real separations for the
        given metric.  If you care about the exact separations for each pair, you should either
        call sample_pairs from a Correlation instance with brute=True or recalculate the
        distances yourself from the original data.

        Also, note that min_sep and max_sep may be arbitrary.  There is no requirement that they
        be edges of one of the standard bins for this correlation function.  There is also no
        requirement that this correlation instance has already accumulated pairs via a call
        to process with these catalogs.

        Parameters:
            n (int):            How many samples to return.
            cat1 (Catalog):     The catalog from which to sample the first object of each pair.
            cat2 (Catalog):     The catalog from which to sample the second object of each pair.
                                (This may be the same as cat1.)
            min_sep (float):    The minimum separation for the returned pairs (modulo some slop
                                allowed by the bin_slop parameter).
            max_sep (float):    The maximum separation for the returned pairs (modulo some slop
                                allowed by the bin_slop parameter).
            metric (str):       Which metric to use.  See `Metrics` for details.  (default:
                                self.metric, or 'Euclidean' if not set yet)

        Returns:
            Tuple containing

                - i2 (array): indices of objects from cat2

def estimate_multi_cov(corrs, method, func=None):
    """Estimate the covariance matrix of multiple statistics.

    This is like the method `BinnedCorr2.estimate_cov`, except that it will acoommodate
    multiple statistics from a list ``corrs`` of `BinnedCorr2` objects.

    Options for ``method`` include:

        - 'shot' = The variance based on "shot noise" only.  This includes the Poisson
          counts of points for N statistics, shape noise for G statistics, and the observed
          scatter in the values for K statistics.  In this case, the returned covariance
          matrix will be diagonal, since there is no way to estimate the off-diagonal terms.
        - 'jackknife' = A jackknife estimate of the covariance matrix based on the scatter
          in the measurement when excluding one patch at a time.
        - 'sample' = An estimate based on the sample covariance of a set of samples,
          taken as the patches of the input catalog.
        - 'bootstrap' = A bootstrap covariance estimate. It selects patches at random with
          replacement and then generates the statistic using all the auto-correlations at
          their selected repetition plus all the cross terms that aren't actually auto terms.
        - 'marked_bootstrap' = An estimate based on a marked-point bootstrap resampling of the
          patches.  Similar to bootstrap, but only samples the patches of the first catalog and
          uses all patches from the second catalog that correspond to each patch selection of
          the first catalog.  cf. https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ApJ...681..726L/

    Both 'bootstrap' and 'marked_bootstrap' use the num_bootstrap parameter, which can be set on
    construction.

    For example, to find the combined covariance matrix for an NG tangential shear statistc,
    along with the GG xi+ and xi- from the same area, using jackknife covariance estimation,
    you would write::

        >>> cov = treecorr.estimate_multi_cov([ng,gg], 'jackknife')

    In all cases, the relevant processing needs to already have been completed and finalized.
    And for all methods other than 'shot', the processing should have involved an appropriate
    number of patches -- preferably more patches than the length of the vector for your
    statistic, although this is not checked.

    The default order of the covariance matrix is to simply concatenate the data vectors
    for each corr in the list ``corrs``.  However, if you want to do something more complicated,
    you may provide an arbitrary function, ``func``, which should act on the list of correlations.
    For instance, if you have several `GGCorrelation` objects and would like to order the
    covariance such that all xi+ results come first, and then all xi- results, you could use

        >>> func = lambda corrs: np.concatenate([c.xip for c in corrs] + [c.xim for c in corrs])

    Or if you want to compute the covariance matrix of some derived quantity like the ratio
    of two correlations, you could use

        >>> func = lambda corrs: corrs[0].xi / corrs[1].xi

    The return value from this func should be a single numpy array. (This is not directly
    checked, but you'll probably get some kind of exception if it doesn't behave as expected.)

    .. note::

        The optional ``func`` parameter is not valid in conjunction with ``method='shot'``.
        It only works for the methods that are based on patch combinations.

    Parameters:
        corrs (list):       A list of `BinnedCorr2` instances.
        method (str):       Which method to use to estimate the covariance matrix.
        func (function):    A unary function that takes the list ``corrs`` and returns the
                            desired full data vector. [default: None, which is equivalent to
                            ``lambda corrs: np.concatenate([c.getStat() for c in corrs])``]

    Returns:
        A numpy array with the estimated covariance matrix.

    # tests done in the test suite.  But the difference is generally pretty small.
