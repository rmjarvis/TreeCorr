class Field(object):
    """A Field in TreeCorr is the object that stores the tree structure we use for efficient
    calculation of the correlation functions.

    The root "cell" in the tree has information about the whole field, including the total
    number of points, the total weight, the mean position, the size (by whcih we mean the
    maximum distance of any point from the mean position), and possibly more information depending
    on which kind of field we have.

    It also points to two sub-cells which each describe about half the points.  These are commonly
    referred to as "daughter cells".  They in turn point to two more cells each, and so on until
    we get to cells that are considered "small enough" according to the `min_size` parameter given
    in the constructor.  These lowest level cells are referred to as "leaves".

    Technically, a Field doesn't have just one of these trees.  To make parallel computation
    more efficient, we actually skip the first few layers of the tree as described above and
    store a list of root cells.  The three parameters that determine how many of these there
    will be are `max_size`, `min_top`, and `max_top`::

        - `max_size` sets the maximum size cell that we want to make sure we have in the trees,
          so the root cells will be at least this large.  The default is None, which means
          we care about all sizes, so there may be only one root cell (but typically more
          because of `min_top`).
        - `min_top` sets the minimum number of initial levels to skip.  The default is 3,
          which means there will be at least 8 root cells (assuming ntot >= 8).
        - `max_top` sets the maximum number of initial levels to skip.  The default is 10,
          which means there could be up to 1024 root cells.

    Finally, the `split_method` parameter sets how the points in a cell should be divided
    when forming the two daughter cells.  The split is always done according to whichever
    dimension has the largest extent.  E.g. if max(\|x - meanx\|) is larger than max(\|y - meany\|)
    and (for 3d) max(\|z - meanz\|), then it will split according to the x values.  But then
    it may split in different ways according to `split_method`.  The allowed values are::

        - 'mean' means to divide the points at the average (mean) value of x, y or z.
        - 'median' means to divide the points at the median value of x, y, or z.
        - 'middle' means to divide the points at midpoint between the minimum and maximum values.
        - 'random' means to divide the points randomly somewhere between the 40th and 60th
          percentile locations in the sorted list.

    Field itself is an abstract base class for the specific types of field classes.
    As such, it cannot be constructed directly.  You should make one of the concrete subclasses:

        - NField describes a field of objects to be counted only.
        - KField describes a field of points sampling a scalar field (e.g. kappa in the
          weak lensing context).  In addition to the above values, cells keep track of
          the mean kappa value in the given region.
        - GField describes a field of points sampling a spinor field (e.g. gamma in the
          weak lensing context).  In addition to the above values, cells keep track of
          the mean (complex) gamma value in the given region.
