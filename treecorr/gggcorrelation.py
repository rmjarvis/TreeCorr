class GGGCorrelation(treecorr.BinnedCorr3):
    """This class handles the calculation and storage of a 3-point shear-shear-shear correlation
    function.

    We use the "natural components" of the shear 3-point function described by Schneider &
    Lombardi (2003) [Astron.Astrophys. 397 (2003) 809-818].  In this paradigm, the shears
    are projected relative to some point defined by the geometry of the triangle.  They
    give several reasonable choices for this point.  We choose the triangle's centroid as the
    "most natural" point, as many simple shear fields have purely real :math:`\\Gamma_0` using
    this definition.  It is also a fairly simple point to calculate in the code compared to
    some of the other options they offer, so projections relative to it are fairly efficient.

    There are 4 complex-valued 3-point shear corrletion functions defined for triples of shear
    values projected relative to the line joining the location of the shear to the cenroid of
    the triangle:

    .. math::

        \\Gamma_0 &= \\langle \\gamma(\\mathbf{x1}) \\gamma(\\mathbf{x2}) \\gamma(\\mathbf{x3}) \\rangle \\\\
        \\Gamma_1 &= \\langle \\gamma(\\mathbf{x1})^* \\gamma(\\mathbf{x2}) \\gamma(\\mathbf{x3}) \\rangle \\\\
        \\Gamma_2 &= \\langle \\gamma(\\mathbf{x1}) \\gamma(\\mathbf{x2})^* \\gamma(\\mathbf{x3}) \\rangle \\\\
        \\Gamma_3 &= \\langle \\gamma(\\mathbf{x1}) \\gamma(\\mathbf{x2}) \\gamma(\\mathbf{x3})^* \\rangle \\\\

    where :math:`\\mathbf{x1}, \\mathbf{x2}, \\mathbf{x3}` are the corners of the triange opposite
    sides `d1, d2, d3` respectively, where `d1 > d2 > d3`, and `*` indicates complex conjugation.

    See the doc string of :class:`~treecorr.BinnedCorr3` for a description of how the triangles
    are binned.

    Ojects of this class holds the following attributes:

        :nbins:     The number of bins in logr where r = d2
        :bin_size:  The size of the bins in logr
        :min_sep:   The minimum separation being considered
        :max_sep:   The maximum separation being considered
        :nubins:    The number of bins in u where u = d3/d2
        :ubin_size: The size of the bins in u
        :min_u:     The minimum u being considered
        :max_u:     The maximum u being considered
        :nvbins:    The number of bins in v where v = +-(d1-d2)/d3
        :vbin_size: The size of the bins in v
        :min_v:     The minimum v being considered
        :max_v:     The maximum v being considered
        :logr1d:    The nominal centers of the nbins bins in log(r).
        :u1d:       The nominal centers of the nubins bins in u.
        :v1d:       The nominal centers of the nvbins bins in v.

    In addition, the following attributes are numpy arrays whose shape is (nbins, nubins, nvbins):

        :logr:      The nominal center of each bin in log(r).
        :rnom:      The nominal center of the bin converted to regular distance.
                    i.e. r = exp(logr).
        :u:         The nominal center of each bin in u.
        :v:         The nominal center of each bin in v.
        :meand1:    The (weighted) mean value of d1 for the triangles in each bin.
        :meanlogd1: The mean value of log(d1) for the triangles in each bin.
        :meand2:    The (weighted) mean value of d2 (aka r) for the triangles in each bin.
        :meanlogd2: The mean value of log(d2) for the triangles in each bin.
        :meand2:    The (weighted) mean value of d3 for the triangles in each bin.
        :meanlogd2: The mean value of log(d3) for the triangles in each bin.
        :meanu:     The mean value of u for the triangles in each bin.
        :meanv:     The mean value of v for the triangles in each bin.
        :gam0:      The 0th "natural" correlation function, :math:`\\Gamma_0(r,u,v)`.
        :gam1:      The 1st "natural" correlation function, :math:`\\Gamma_1(r,u,v)`.
        :gam2:      The 2nd "natural" correlation function, :math:`\\Gamma_2(r,u,v)`.
        :gam3:      The 3rd "natural" correlation function, :math:`\\Gamma_3(r,u,v)`.
        :vargam:    The variance of :math:`\\Gamma` values, only including the shot noise
                    propagated into the final correlation.  This does not include sample variance,
                    so it is always an underestimate of the actual variance.
        :weight:    The total weight in each bin.
        :ntri:      The number of triangles going into each bin.

    If `sep_units` are given (either in the config dict or as a named kwarg) then the distances
    will all be in these units.  Note however, that if you separate out the steps of the
    :func:`process` command and use :func:`process_auto` and/or :func:`process_cross`, then the
    units will not be applied to :meanr: or :meanlogr: until the :func:`finalize` function is
    called.

    The typical usage pattern is as follows::

        >>> ggg = treecorr.GGGCorrelation(config)
        >>> ggg.process(cat)              # For auto-correlation.
        >>> ggg.process(cat1,cat2,cat3)   # For cross-correlation.
        >>> ggg.write(file_name)          # Write out to a file.
        >>> gam0 = ggg.gam0, etc.         # To access gamma values directly.
        >>> gam0r = ggg.gam0r             # You can also access real and imag parts separately.
        >>> gam0i = ggg.gam0i

    :param config:      A configuration dict that can be used to pass in kwargs if desired.
                        This dict is allowed to have addition entries in addition to those listed
                        in :class:`~treecorr.BinnedCorr3`, which are ignored here. (default: None)
    :param logger:      If desired, a logger object for logging. (default: None, in which case
                        one will be built according to the config dict's verbose level.)

    See the documentation for :class:`~treecorr.BinnedCorr3` for the list of other allowed kwargs,
    which may be passed either directly or in the config dict.
