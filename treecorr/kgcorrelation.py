class KGCorrelation(BaseKZCorrelation):
    r"""This class handles the calculation and storage of a 2-point scalar-shear correlation
    function.

    .. note::

        While we use the term kappa (:math:`\kappa`) here and the letter K in various places,
        in fact any scalar field will work here.  For example, you can use this to compute
        correlations of some survey property, such as seeing, with shear, where "kappa" would
        really be the measured property, e.g. the observed sizes of the stars.

    Ojects of this class holds the following attributes:

    Attributes:
        nbins:     The number of bins in logr
        bin_size:  The size of the bins in logr
        min_sep:   The minimum separation being considered
        max_sep:   The maximum separation being considered

    In addition, the following attributes are numpy arrays of length (nbins):

    Attributes:
        logr:       The nominal center of the bin in log(r) (the natural logarithm of r).
        rnom:       The nominal center of the bin converted to regular distance.
                    i.e. r = exp(logr).
        meanr:      The (weighted) mean value of r for the pairs in each bin.
                    If there are no pairs in a bin, then exp(logr) will be used instead.
        meanlogr:   The (weighted) mean value of log(r) for the pairs in each bin.
                    If there are no pairs in a bin, then logr will be used instead.
        xi:         The correlation function, :math:`\xi(r) = \langle \kappa\, \gamma_T\rangle`.
        xi_im:      The imaginary part of :math:`\xi(r)`.
        varxi:      An estimate of the variance of :math:`\xi`
        weight:     The total weight in each bin.
        npairs:     The number of pairs going into each bin (including pairs where one or
                    both objects have w=0).
        cov:        An estimate of the full covariance matrix.

    .. note::

        The default method for estimating the variance and covariance attributes (``varxi``,
        and ``cov``) is 'shot', which only includes the shape noise propagated into the final
        correlation.  This does not include sample variance, so it is always an underestimate of
        the actual variance.  To get better estimates, you need to set ``var_method`` to something
        else and use patches in the input catalog(s).  cf. `Covariance Estimates`.

    If ``sep_units`` are given (either in the config dict or as a named kwarg) then the distances
    will all be in these units.

    .. note::

        If you separate out the steps of the `Corr2.process` command and use `Corr2.process_cross`,
        then the units will not be applied to ``meanr`` or ``meanlogr`` until the `finalize`
        function is called.

    The typical usage pattern is as follows:

        >>> kg = treecorr.KGCorrelation(config)
        >>> kg.process(cat1,cat2)   # Calculate the cross-correlation
        >>> kg.write(file_name)     # Write out to a file.
        >>> xi = kg.xi              # Or access the correlation function directly.

    Parameters:
        config (dict):  A configuration dict that can be used to pass in kwargs if desired.
                        This dict is allowed to have addition entries besides those listed
                        in `Corr2`, which are ignored here. (default: None)
        logger:         If desired, a logger object for logging. (default: None, in which case
                        one will be built according to the config dict's verbose level.)

    Keyword Arguments:
        **kwargs:       See the documentation for `Corr2` for the list of allowed keyword
                        arguments, which may be passed either directly or in the config dict.

        If ``sep_units`` was given at construction, then the distances will all be in these units.
