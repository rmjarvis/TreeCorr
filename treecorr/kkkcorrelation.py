class KKKCorrelation(treecorr.BinnedCorr3):
    r"""This class handles the calculation and storage of a 3-point kappa-kappa-kappa correlation
    function.

    .. note::

        While we use the term kappa (:math:`\kappa`) here and the letter K in various places,
        in fact any scalar field will work here.  For example, you can use this to compute
        correlations of the CMB temperature fluctuations, where "kappa" would really be
        :math:`\Delta T`.

    See the doc string of `BinnedCorr3` for a description of how the triangles are binned.

    Ojects of this class holds the following attributes:

    Attributes:
        nbins:      The number of bins in logr where r = d2
        bin_size:   The size of the bins in logr
        min_sep:    The minimum separation being considered
        max_sep:    The maximum separation being considered
        nubins:     The number of bins in u where u = d3/d2
        ubin_size:  The size of the bins in u
        min_u:      The minimum u being considered
        max_u:      The maximum u being considered
        nvbins:     The number of bins in v where v = +-(d1-d2)/d3
        vbin_size:  The size of the bins in v
        min_v:      The minimum v being considered
        max_v:      The maximum v being considered
        logr1d:     The nominal centers of the nbins bins in log(r).
        u1d:        The nominal centers of the nubins bins in u.
        v1d:        The nominal centers of the nvbins bins in v.

    In addition, the following attributes are numpy arrays whose shape is (nbins, nubins, nvbins):

    Attributes:
        logr:       The nominal center of the bin in log(r).
        rnom:       The nominal center of the bin converted to regular distance.
                    i.e. r = exp(logr).
        u:          The nominal center of the bin in u.
        v:          The nominal center of the bin in v.
        meand1:     The (weighted) mean value of d1 for the triangles in each bin.
        meanlogd1:  The mean value of log(d1) for the triangles in each bin.
        meand2:     The (weighted) mean value of d2 (aka r) for the triangles in each bin.
        meanlogd2:  The mean value of log(d2) for the triangles in each bin.
        meand2:     The (weighted) mean value of d3 for the triangles in each bin.
        meanlogd2:  The mean value of log(d3) for the triangles in each bin.
        meanu:      The mean value of u for the triangles in each bin.
        meanv:      The mean value of v for the triangles in each bin.
        zeta:       The correlation function, :math:`\zeta(r,u,v)`.
        varzeta:    The variance of :math:`\zeta`, only including the shot noise propagated into
                    the final correlation.  This does not include sample variance, so it is always
                    an underestimate of the actual variance.
        weight:     The total weight in each bin.
        ntri:       The number of triangles going into each bin (including those where one or
                    more objects have w=0).

    If ``sep_units`` are given (either in the config dict or as a named kwarg) then the distances
    will all be in these units.

    .. note::

        If you separate out the steps of the `process` command and use `process_auto` and/or
        `process_cross`, then the units will not be applied to ``meanr`` or ``meanlogr`` until
        the `finalize` function is called.

    The typical usage pattern is as follows:

        >>> kkk = treecorr.KKKCorrelation(config)
        >>> kkk.process(cat)              # For auto-correlation.
        >>> kkk.process(cat1,cat2,cat3)   # For cross-correlation.
        >>> kkk.write(file_name)          # Write out to a file.
        >>> zeta = kkk.zeta               # To access zeta directly.

    Parameters:
        config (dict):  A configuration dict that can be used to pass in kwargs if desired.
                        This dict is allowed to have addition entries besides those listed
                        in `BinnedCorr3`, which are ignored here. (default: None)
        logger:         If desired, a logger object for logging. (default: None, in which case
                        one will be built according to the config dict's verbose level.)

    Keyword Arguments:
        **kwargs:       See the documentation for `BinnedCorr3` for the list of allowed keyword
                        arguments, which may be passed either directly or in the config dict.

        - If only 1 argument is given, then compute an auto-correlation function.
        - If 2 arguments are given, then compute a cross-correlation function with the
          first catalog taking two corners of the triangles. (Not implemented yet.)
        - If 3 arguments are given, then compute a cross-correlation function.

        All arguments may be lists, in which case all items in the list are used

            For a correlation of multiple catalogs, it matters which corner of the
            triangle comes from which catalog.  The final accumulation will have

            points in cat1,cat3; and d3 is between points in cat1,cat2.  To accumulate
            all the possible triangles between three catalogs, you should call this
            multiple times with the different catalogs in different positions.
