class KKKCorrelation(treecorr.BinnedCorr3):
    """This class handles the calculation and storage of a 3-point kappa-kappa-kappa correlation
    function.

    Note: while we use the term kappa here and the letter K in various places, in fact
    any scalar field will work here.  For example, you can use this to compute correlations
    of the CMB temperature fluctuations, where "kappa" would really be delta T.

    See the doc string of :class:`~treecorr.BinnedCorr3` for a description of how the triangles
    are binned.

    Ojects of this class holds the following attributes:

        :nbins:     The number of bins in logr where r = d2
        :bin_size:  The size of the bins in logr
        :min_sep:   The minimum separation being considered
        :max_sep:   The maximum separation being considered
        :nubins:    The number of bins in u where u = d3/d2
        :ubin_size: The size of the bins in u
        :min_u:     The minimum u being considered
        :max_u:     The maximum u being considered
        :nvbins:    The number of bins in v where v = +-(d1-d2)/d3
        :vbin_size: The size of the bins in v
        :min_v:     The minimum v being considered
        :max_v:     The maximum v being considered
        :logr1d:    The nominal centers of the nbins bins in log(r).
        :u1d:       The nominal centers of the nubins bins in u.
        :v1d:       The nominal centers of the nvbins bins in v.

    In addition, the following attributes are numpy arrays whose shape is (nbins, nubins, nvbins):

        :logr:      The nominal center of the bin in log(r).
        :rnom:      The nominal center of the bin converted to regular distance.
                    i.e. r = exp(logr).
        :u:         The nominal center of the bin in u.
        :v:         The nominal center of the bin in v.
        :meand1:    The (weighted) mean value of d1 for the triangles in each bin.
        :meanlogd1: The mean value of log(d1) for the triangles in each bin.
        :meand2:    The (weighted) mean value of d2 (aka r) for the triangles in each bin.
        :meanlogd2: The mean value of log(d2) for the triangles in each bin.
        :meand2:    The (weighted) mean value of d3 for the triangles in each bin.
        :meanlogd2: The mean value of log(d3) for the triangles in each bin.
        :meanu:     The mean value of u for the triangles in each bin.
        :meanv:     The mean value of v for the triangles in each bin.
        :zeta:      The correlation function, :math:`\\zeta(r,u,v)`.
        :varzeta:   The variance of :math:`\\zeta`, only including the shot noise propagated into
                    the final correlation.  This does not include sample variance, so it is always
                    an underestimate of the actual variance.
        :weight:    The total weight in each bin.
        :ntri:      The number of triangles going into each bin.

    If `sep_units` are given (either in the config dict or as a named kwarg) then the distances
    will all be in these units.  Note however, that if you separate out the steps of the
    :func:`process` command and use :func:`process_auto` and/or :func:`process_cross`, then the
    units will not be applied to :meanr: or :meanlogr: until the :func:`finalize` function is
    called.

    The typical usage pattern is as follows:

        >>> kkk = treecorr.KKKCorrelation(config)
        >>> kkk.process(cat)              # For auto-correlation.
        >>> kkk.process(cat1,cat2,cat3)   # For cross-correlation.
        >>> kkk.write(file_name)          # Write out to a file.
        >>> zeta = kkk.zeta               # To access zeta directly.

    :param config:      A configuration dict that can be used to pass in kwargs if desired.
                        This dict is allowed to have addition entries in addition to those listed
                        in :class:`~treecorr.BinnedCorr3`, which are ignored here. (default: None)
    :param logger:      If desired, a logger object for logging. (default: None, in which case
                        one will be built according to the config dict's verbose level.)

    See the documentation for :class:`~treecorr.BinnedCorr3` for the list of other allowed kwargs,
    which may be passed either directly or in the config dict.
