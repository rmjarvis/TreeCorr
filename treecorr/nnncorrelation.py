class NNNCorrelation(Corr3):
    """This class handles the calculation and storage of a 3-point count-count-count correlation
    function.

    See the doc string of `Corr3` for a description of how the triangles are binned along
    with the attributes related to the different binning options.

    The typical usage pattern is as follows:

        >>> nnn = treecorr.NNNCorrelation(config)
        >>> nnn.process(cat)         # For auto-correlation.
        >>> rrr.process(rand)        # Likewise for random-random correlations
        >>> drr.process(cat,rand)    # If desired, also do data-random correlations
        >>> rdd.process(rand,cat)    # Also with two data and one random
        >>> nnn.write(file_name,rrr=rrr,drr=drr,...)  # Write out to a file.
        >>> zeta,varzeta = nnn.calculateZeta(rrr=rrr,drr=drr,rdd=rdd)  # Or get zeta directly.

    Parameters:
        config (dict):  A configuration dict that can be used to pass in kwargs if desired.
                        This dict is allowed to have addition entries besides those listed
                        in `Corr3`, which are ignored here. (default: None)
        logger:         If desired, a logger object for logging. (default: None, in which case
                        one will be built according to the config dict's verbose level.)

    Keyword Arguments:
        **kwargs:       See the documentation for `Corr3` for the list of allowed keyword
                        arguments, which may be passed either directly or in the config dict.

        points using the same mask, and possibly cross correlations of the data and random.

        There are two possible formulae that are currently supported.

        1. The simplest formula to use is :math:`\zeta^\prime = (DDD-RRR)/RRR`.
           In this case, only rrr needs to be given, the `NNNCorrelation` of a random field.
           However, note that in this case, the return value is not normally called :math:`\zeta`.
           Rather, this is an estimator of

           .. math::

               \zeta^\prime(d_1,d_2,d_3) = \zeta(d_1,d_2,d_3) + \xi(d_1) + \xi(d_2) + \xi(d_3)

           where :math:`\xi` is the two-point correlation function for each leg of the triangle.
           You would typically want to calculate that separately and subtract off the
           two-point contributions.

        2. For auto-correlations, a better formula is :math:`\zeta = (DDD-RDD+DRR-RRR)/RRR`.
           In this case, RDD is the number of triangles where 1 point comes from the randoms
           and 2 points are from the data. Similarly, DRR has 1 point from the data and 2 from
           the randoms.  These are what are calculated from calling::

                >>> drr.process(data_cat, rand_cat)
                >>> rdd.process(rand_cat, data_cat)

           .. note::

                One might thing the formula should be :math:`\zeta = (DDD-3RDD+3DRR-RRR)/RRR`
                by analogy with the 2pt Landy-Szalay formula. However, the way these are
                calculated, the object we are calling RDD already includes triangles where R
                is in each of the 3 locations.  So it is really more like RDD + DRD + DDR.
                These are not computed separately.  Rather the single computation of ``rdd``
                described above accumulates all three permutations together.  So that one
                object includes everything for the second term.  Likewise ``drr`` has all the
                permutations that are relevant for the third term.

        - If only rrr is provided, the first formula will be used.
        - If all of rrr, drr, rdd are provided then the second will be used.

        .. note::

            This method is not valid for bin_type='LogMultipole'. I don't think there is
            a straightforward way to go directly from the multipole expoansion of DDD and
            RRR to Zeta.  Normally one would instead convert both to LogSAS binning
            (cf. `toSAS`) and then call `calculateZeta` with those.

        Parameters:
            rrr (NNNCorrelation):   The auto-correlation of the random field (RRR)
            drr (NNNCorrelation):   DRR if desired. (default: None)
            rdd (NNNCorrelation):   RDD if desired. (default: None)

        Normally, at least rrr should be provided, but if this is None, then only the
        basic accumulated number of triangles are output (along with the columns parametrizing
        the size and shape of the triangles).

        If at least rrr is given, then it will output an estimate of the final 3pt correlation
        function, :math:`\zeta`. There are two possible formulae that are currently supported.

        1. The simplest formula to use is :math:`\zeta^\prime = (DDD-RRR)/RRR`.
           In this case, only rrr needs to be given, the `NNNCorrelation` of a random field.
           However, note that in this case, the return value is not what is normally called
           :math:`\zeta`.  Rather, this is an estimator of

           .. math::
               \zeta^\prime(d_1,d_2,d_3) = \zeta(d_1,d_2,d_3) + \xi(d_1) + \xi(d_2) + \xi(d_3)

           where :math:`\xi` is the two-point correlation function for each leg of the triangle.
           You would typically want to calculate that separately and subtract off the
           two-point contributions.

        2. For auto-correlations, a better formula is :math:`\zeta = (DDD-RDD+DRR-RRR)/RRR`.
           In this case, RDD is the number of triangles where 1 point comes from the randoms
           and 2 points are from the data. Similarly, DRR has 1 point from the data and 2 from
           the randoms.
           For this case, all combinations rrr, drr, and rdd must be provided.
