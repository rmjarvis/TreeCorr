class NNNCorrelation(treecorr.BinnedCorr3):
    """This class handles the calculation and storage of a 2-point count-count correlation
    function.  i.e. the regular density correlation function.

    See the doc string of `BinnedCorr3` for a description of how the triangles are binned.

    Ojects of this class holds the following attributes:

    Attributes:
        logr:       The nominal center of the bin in log(r) (the natural logarithm of r).
        nbins:      The number of bins in logr where r = d2
        bin_size:   The size of the bins in logr
        min_sep:    The minimum separation being considered
        max_sep:    The maximum separation being considered
        nubins:     The number of bins in u where u = d3/d2
        ubin_size:  The size of the bins in u
        min_u:      The minimum u being considered
        max_u:      The maximum u being considered
        nvbins:     The number of bins in v where v = +-(d1-d2)/d3
        vbin_size:  The size of the bins in v
        min_v:      The minimum v being considered
        max_v:      The maximum v being considered
        logr1d:     The nominal centers of the nbins bins in log(r).
        u1d:        The nominal centers of the nubins bins in u.
        v1d:        The nominal centers of the nvbins bins in v.

    In addition, the following attributes are numpy arrays whose shape is (nbins, nubins, nvbins):

    Attributes:
        logr:       The nominal center of the bin in log(r).
        rnom:       The nominal center of the bin converted to regular distance.
                    i.e. r = exp(logr).
        u:          The nominal center of the bin in u.
        v:          The nominal center of the bin in v.
        meand1:     The (weighted) mean value of d1 for the triangles in each bin.
        meanlogd1:  The mean value of log(d1) for the triangles in each bin.
        meand2:     The (weighted) mean value of d2 (aka r) for the triangles in each bin.
        meanlogd2:  The mean value of log(d2) for the triangles in each bin.
        meand2:     The (weighted) mean value of d3 for the triangles in each bin.
        meanlogd2:  The mean value of log(d3) for the triangles in each bin.
        meanu:      The mean value of u for the triangles in each bin.
        meanv:      The mean value of v for the triangles in each bin.
        weight:     The total weight in each bin.
        ntri:       The number of triangles going into each bin (including those where one or
                    more objects have w=0).
        tot:        The total number of triangles processed, which is used to normalize
                    the randoms if they have a different number of triangles.

    If ``sep_units`` are given (either in the config dict or as a named kwarg) then the distances
    will all be in these units.

    .. note::

        If you separate out the steps of the `process` command and use `process_auto` and/or
        `process_cross`, then the units will not be applied to ``meanr`` or ``meanlogr`` until
        the `finalize` function is called.

    The typical usage pattern is as follows:

        >>> nnn = treecorr.NNNCorrelation(config)
        >>> nnn.process(cat)         # For auto-correlation.
        >>> nnn.process(cat1,cat2,cat3)   # For cross-correlation.
        >>> rrr.process...           # Likewise for random-random correlations
        >>> drr.process...           # If desired, also do data-random correlations
        >>> rdr.process...           # ... in all three
        >>> rrd.process...           # ... permutations
        >>> rdd.process...           # Also with two data and one random
        >>> drd.process...           # ... in all three
        >>> ddr.process...           # ... permutations
        >>> nn.write(file_name,rrr,drr,...)  # Write out to a file.
        >>> zeta,varzeta = nnn.calculateZeta(rrr,drr,...)  # Or get the 3pt function directly.

    Parameters:
        config (dict):  A configuration dict that can be used to pass in kwargs if desired.
                        This dict is allowed to have addition entries besides those listed
                        in `BinnedCorr3`, which are ignored here. (default: None)
        logger:         If desired, a logger object for logging. (default: None, in which case
                        one will be built according to the config dict's verbose level.)

    Keyword Arguments:
        **kwargs:       See the documentation for `BinnedCorr3` for the list of allowed keyword
                        arguments, which may be passed either directly or in the config dict.

        There are two possible formulae that are currently supported.

        1. The simplest formula to use is :math:`\zeta^\prime = (DDD-RRR)/RRR`.
           In this case, only rrr needs to be given, the `NNNCorrelation` of a random field.
           However, note that in this case, the return value is not normally called :math:`\zeta`.

               \zeta^\prime(d_1,d_2,d_3) = \zeta(d_1,d_2,d_3) + \xi(d_1) + \xi(d_2) + \xi(d_3)

           where :math:`\xi` is the two-point correlation function for each leg of the triangle.
           You would typically want to calculate that separately and subtract off the
           two-point contributions.

        2. For auto-correlations, a better formula is
           :math:`\zeta = (DDD-DDR-DRD-RDD+DRR+RDR+RRD-RRR)/RRR`.
           In this case, DDR, etc. calculate the triangles where two points come from either
           the data or the randoms.  In the case of DDR for instance, points x1 and x2 on the
           triangle have data and x3 uses randoms, where points x1, x2, x3 are opposite sides
           d1, d2, d3 with d1 > d2 > d3 as usual; RDR has randoms at 1,3 and data at 2, etc.

        - If only rrr is provided, the first formula will be used.
        - If all of rrr, drr, rdr, rrd, ddr, drd, rdd are provided then the second will be used.

        Parameters:
            rrr (NNNCorrelation):   The auto-correlation of the random field (RRR)
            drr (NNNCorrelation):   DRR if desired. (default: None)
